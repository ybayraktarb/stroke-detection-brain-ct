# stroke-detection-brain-ct
Deep learning-based stroke detection on brain CT images using CNNs and ensemble models


## Project Overview

This project aims to classify CT slices as either:

- `Normal`
- `Stroke`

The model uses transfer learning and fine-tuning on CNN architectures with advanced metrics and threshold optimization techniques.
